\title{Download requested archive files}
\usage{
data_download(requested_data, account_login, path = ".", unzip = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{requested_data}{data.frame A tibble with archive metadata that must
include at minimum a \code{download} column (full download URL) and an \code{id}
column used for tracking.}

\item{account_login}{list Output from \code{\link[=account_login]{account_login()}} containing the
authenticated session used to fetch file content.}

\item{path}{character(1) Filesystem path where downloaded files will be
written and (if \code{unzip = TRUE}) extracted. The path must already exist.}

\item{unzip}{logical(1) If TRUE (default) extract the downloaded .7z archive
using archive::archive_extract and delete the archive file afterwards.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Side effects: files written to \code{path} and
background processes spawned to perform file writes / extraction.
}
\description{
Download one or more files listed in \code{requested_data} using the authenticated
session in \code{account_login}. Files are written to \code{path}. Downloads occur in
the calling R process but the file write and optional extraction are
performed in a background R process (via callr::r_bg). If \code{unzip = TRUE}
the original archive is removed after extraction.
}
\details{
The function uses rvest::session_jump_to() to request each download
URL and then launches a background R process to write the binary content
and optionally extract it. The function is silent about progress and
returns invisibly; background processes are left running under callr.
