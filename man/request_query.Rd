\title{Create a LOBSTER data request (one row per trading day)}
\usage{
request_query(
  symbol,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  level,
  validate = TRUE,
  account_archive = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol}{character vector One or more ticker symbols (e.g. "AAPL").
Each element is paired with the corresponding elements of \code{start_date},
\code{end_date} and \code{level}. Recycling follows base R rules; mismatched lengths
should be avoided.}

\item{start_date}{Date-like (Date or character) Start date(s) for the
requested range(s). Each start date is converted with \code{as.Date()}.}

\item{end_date}{Date-like (Date or character) End date(s) for the
requested range(s). Each end date is converted with \code{as.Date()}.}

\item{level}{integer(1) Required order-book snapshot level (e.g. 1, 2).}

\item{validate}{logical(1) If TRUE (default) remove weekend days and NYSE
holidays and — when \code{account_archive} is supplied — remove days already
present in the account archive.}

\item{account_archive}{data.frame or tibble, optional Archive table as
returned by \code{\link[=account_archive]{account_archive()}}. When provided, rows that match
(symbol, start_date, end_date, level, size, download, id) are excluded
from the returned request.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data.frame) with one row per trading day and columns:
\itemize{
\item symbol: character
\item start_date: Date
\item end_date: Date (equal to start_date for daily requests)
\item level: integer
}

The function returns only the days that remain after optional validation.
}
\description{
Construct a request describing which trading-day files to ask LOBSTER for.
For each symbol and date range the function expands the range to one row per
calendar day, converts the level to integer, and (optionally) validates the
requested days by removing weekends, NYSE holidays and any days already
present in the provided account archive.
}
\details{
The function does not perform network activity. Use
\code{\link[=request_submit]{request_submit()}} to send the generated requests to the authenticated
LOBSTER session.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single symbol, one-month range
req <- request_query("AAPL", "2020-01-01", "2020-01-31", level = 2)

# Multiple symbols / ranges (vectorised inputs)
req <- request_query(
  symbol = c("AAPL", "MSFT"),
  start_date = c("2020-01-01", "2020-02-01"),
  end_date = c("2020-01-03", "2020-02-03"),
  level = c(1, 1)
)
}
