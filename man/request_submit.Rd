\title{Submit one or more requests to an authenticated LOBSTER account}
\usage{
request_submit(account_login, request)
}
\arguments{
\item{account_login}{list Output from \code{\link[=account_login]{account_login()}} that contains a
successful authenticated session (\code{valid == TRUE}) and the submission
response required for navigation.}

\item{request}{data.frame A tibble as returned by \code{\link[=request_query]{request_query()}} with
columns: symbol, start_date, end_date, level.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The primary effect is to submit requests to
the remote service; any responses are not returned by this function.
}
\description{
Send the prepared request rows to lobsterdata.com using the authenticated
session contained in \code{account_login}. Each row in \code{request} is submitted
as a separate request. This function performs network side effects and
returns invisibly.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each row of the \code{request} data frame and
submits a separate AJAX request to the LOBSTER server. The processing
happens asynchronously on the server side, so the function returns
immediately after submission. Use \code{\link{account_archive}} to check
when the data becomes available for download.
}

\dontrun{
# Login to your account
my_account <- account_login("user@example.com", "password")

# Create a data request
req <- request_query(
  symbol = "AAPL",
  start_date = "2024-01-02",
  end_date = "2024-01-05",
  level = 10
)

# Submit the request
request_submit(account_login = my_account, request = req)

# Wait for processing (may take several minutes)
# Then check your archive
archive <- account_archive(my_account)
}
