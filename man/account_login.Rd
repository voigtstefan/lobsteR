\item{pwd}{character(1) Account password.}
}
\value{
A list containing authentication details:
\describe{
\item{valid}{Logical indicating if login was successful}
\item{session}{httr session object for the authenticated session}
\item{submission}{httr response object from the login submission}
}

A named list with components:

\item{session}{rvest session object used for further navigation.}
\item{submission}{rvest response returned after the sign-in form was submitted.}
}
}
\description{
Logs into your LOBSTER account and creates a session object for subsequent
data requests. This function handles the authentication process with
lobsterdata.com and validates the login was successful.
}
\details{
The function performs form-based authentication by:
\enumerate{
\item Creating a session with the LOBSTER sign-in page
\item Filling and submitting the login form
\item Validating the response URL to confirm successful authentication
}

A successful login redirects to the request data page. The returned object
should be passed to other functions like \code{\link{account_archive}} and
\code{\link{request_submit}}.

The function submits the sign-in form using an AJAX header
(x-requested-with: XMLHttpRequest) and confirms success by checking the
redirect URL. Network connectivity and valid credentials are required.
