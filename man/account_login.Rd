Logs into your LOBSTER account and creates a session object for subsequent
data requests. This function handles the authentication process with
lobsterdata.com and validates the login was successful.
}
\details{
The function performs form-based authentication by:
\enumerate{
\item Creating a session with the LOBSTER sign-in page
\item Filling and submitting the login form
\item Validating the response URL to confirm successful authentication
}

A successful login redirects to the request data page. The returned object
should be passed to other functions like \code{\link{account_archive}} and
\code{\link{request_submit}}.
