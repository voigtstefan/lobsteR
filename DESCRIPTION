Description: Tools to programmatically access, download and prepare high-frequency
    limit order book data from lobsterdata.com. The package provides functions
    for authentication, robust (batched and retrying) downloads, archive
    verification and extraction, parsing of LOBSTER CSV files, and common
    preprocessing (timestamp parsing and alignment, price/size normalization,
    timezone handling, and optional resampling). Outputs are tidy tibbles
    suitable for high-frequency econometric and market-microstructure analysis
    and for downstream tidyverse workflows.
